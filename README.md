# Quick Intro
👋 Hi, I’m @andrea-antal, formerly @dreachan. I'm a Senior Product Manager living in Vancouver, Canada.

# What am I working on

## 👩🏻‍🔬 DREA LABS
My project portfolio site that I've decided to build as a 2D point-and-click adventure game, using three.js and figuring out basic game development for the first time. 

## 🍽️ AI Meal Planner
I've been building this since December 2025 as a hands-on way to learn Claude Code and AI-native app development. It solves a real problem for my family: generating weekly meal plans that account for allergies, preferences, and what's actually in the fridge. Currently in closed beta and being used by real families each week.
