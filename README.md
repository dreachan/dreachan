# What am I working on

## 🍽️ AI Meal Planner
I've been building this since December 2025 as a hands-on way to learn Claude Code and AI-native app development. It solves a real problem for my family: generating weekly meal plans that account for allergies, preferences, and what's actually in the fridge. Currently in closed beta and being used by real families each week.
